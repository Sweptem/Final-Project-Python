The weather.py file is a Python-based program that retrieves and displays weather information for specified cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
The program provides a menu-driven interface offering options to fetch current weather data for a chosen city, view previously fetched data stored in an SQLite database, and exit the application.

Features:
Get Weather: Users can input a city name and retrieve the current weather information, including temperature and weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny).
Display Database: Allows users to view previously fetched weather data stored in an SQLite database. This feature presents the stored city, weather description, and temperature data retrieved from past API requests.
